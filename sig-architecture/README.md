# Details about SIG-Architecture sub-projects

## Architecture and API Governance

Establishing and documenting design principles, documenting and evolving the system architecture, reviewing, curating, and documenting new extension patterns

Establishing and documenting conventions for system and user-facing APIs, define and operate the APl review process, final API implementation consistency validation, co-own top-level API directories with API machinery; maintaining, evolving, and enforcing the deprecation policy

* [Kubernetes Design and Architecture](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/architecture.md)
* [Design principles](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/principles.md)
* [API conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md)
* [API Review process](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-architecture/api-review-process.md)
* [Deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/deprecation-policy/)

Please see the [Design documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/architecture-tracking/projects/4) and [API Reviews](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/architecture-tracking/projects/3) tracking boards to follow the work of this sub-project. Please reach out to folks in the [OWNERS](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/OWNERS) file if you are interested in joining this effort.

## Conformance Definition

Reviewing, approving, and driving changes to the conformance test suite; reviewing, guiding, and creating new conformance profiles

* [Conformance Tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/conformance/testdata/conformance.txt)
* [Test Guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/conformance-tests.md)

Please see the [Conformance Test Review](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/architecture-tracking/projects/1) tracking board to follow the work for this sub-project. Please reach out to folks in the [OWNERS](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/test/conformance/testdata/OWNERS) file if you are interested in joining this effort. There is a lot of overlap with the [Kubernetes Software Conformance Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/README-WG.md) with this sub project as well. The github group [cncf-conformance-wg](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/cncf-conformance-wg) enumerates the folks on this working group. Look for the `area/conformance` label in the kubernetes repositories to mark [issues](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aarea%2Fconformance) and [PRs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Aarea%2Fconformance) 

## KEP Adoption and Reviews

Develop and drive technical enhancement review process

* [KEP Process](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/0001-kubernetes-enhancement-proposal-process.md)
* [Template](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/0000-kep-template.md)

Please see the [KEP Tracking](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/architecture-tracking/projects/2) board to follow the work of this sub-project. Please reach out to folks in the [OWNERS](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/keps/OWNERS) file if you are interested in joining this effort.

## Code Organization

Overall code organization, including github repositories and branching methodology, top-level and pkg OWNERS of kubernetes/kubernetes, vendoring

Please reach out to folks in the [OWNERS](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/vendor/OWNERS) file if you are interested in joining this effort.
