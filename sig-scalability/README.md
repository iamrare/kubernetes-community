# Scalability Special Interest Group

SIG Scalability is responsible for defining and driving scalability goals for Kubernetes. We also coordinate and contribute to general system-wide scalability and performance improvements (not falling into the charter of other individual SIGs) by driving large architectural changes and finding bottlenecks, as well as provide guidance and consultations about any scalability and performance related aspects of Kubernetes.
We are actively working on finding and removing various scalability bottlenecks which should lead us towards pushing system's scalability higher. This may include going beyond 5k nodes in the future - although that's not our priority as of now, this is very deeply in our area of interest and we are happy to guide and collaborate on any efforts towards that goal as long as they are not sacrificing on overall Kubernetes architecture (by making it non-maintainable, non-understandable, etc.).

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the Scalability Special Interest Group.
