# Contributor Experience Special Interest Group

Developing and sustaining a healthy community of contributors is critical to scaling the project and growing the ecosystem. We need to ensure our contributors are happy and productive, and that there are not bottlenecks hindering the project in, for example: feature velocity, community scaling, pull request latency, and absolute numbers of open pull requests and open issues.

The [charter](charter.md) defines the scope and governance of the Contributor Experience Special Interest Group.
