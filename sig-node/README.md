- Node API (with [sig-architecture](../sig-architecture))
- Node controller
- Node level performance and scalability (with [sig-scalability](../sig-scalability))
- Node reliability (problem detection and remediation)
- Node lifecycle management (with [sig-cluster-lifecycle](../sig-cluster-lifecycle))
- Container runtimes
- Device management
- Image management
- Node-level resource management (with [sig-scheduling](../sig-scheduling))
