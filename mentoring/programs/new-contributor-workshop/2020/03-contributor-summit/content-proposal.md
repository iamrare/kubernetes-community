## Introduction

### 9:30 - 11:00 Intro Communications and Community 
Alison, Rob, Rael, Josh: support/segment?

Note: Although these will have to be run separately, the content will be the same.

* From San Diego page
*Try to represent the journey of a contributor with the slides*

* *Linking the key ideas themes, with walking along a brick road or similar. From cat to kubecat. *Or capybara to kubeybara
